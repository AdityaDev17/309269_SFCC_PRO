## Atoms

## BreadcrumbA collection of accessible and composable breadcrumb navigation components used to indicate the current page’s location within a navigational hierarchy.### BreadcrumbThe root wrapper component that renders a `<nav>` element with `aria-label="breadcrumb"`.**Props:**- Accepts all standard props for `<nav>`.- Optional `separator` prop for custom implementations (not used directly in the base component).### BreadcrumbListRenders the breadcrumb items inside an `<ol>` list.**Props:**- Accepts all standard props for `<ol>`.- Applies default breadcrumb list styling via `Breadcrumbs.module.css`.### BreadcrumbItemRepresents an individual breadcrumb item (`<li>`).**Props:**- Accepts all standard props for `<li>`.- Styled through `Breadcrumbs.module.css`.### BreadcrumbLinkA link component for a breadcrumb item.**Props:**- Accepts all standard props for `<a>`.- **asChild** (boolean, optional): If true, uses Radix UI's `Slot` to render the passed child component.- Applies consistent breadcrumb link styles.### BreadcrumbPageUsed to indicate the current page in the breadcrumb trail.**Props:**- Accepts all standard props for `<span>`.### BreadcrumbSeparatorUsed between breadcrumb items to visually separate them.**Props:**- Accepts all standard props for `<li>`.- Defaults to a right-chevron icon (`<ChevronRight />`) if no children are passed.- `aria-hidden` is applied for accessibility.### BreadcrumbEllipsisRenders an ellipsis icon (three dots) when breadcrumb items are truncated.**Props:**- Accepts all standard props for `<span>`.- Includes screen reader support for accessibility.### Wrapper ConceptThe **BreadcrumbWrapper** (`Breadcrumbs` component) serves as the main container and logic controller for rendering the breadcrumb navigation. It accepts the `breadcrumbItems` array that consists of `label` and optional `href` values for each breadcrumb item. The `breadcrumbSeparator` prop allows customization of the separator used between breadcrumb items, defaulting to a path to an image (`/slash.svg`). This makes the `Breadcrumbs` component flexible and reusable in various contexts while maintaining consistent structure and behavior for accessibility.The wrapper processes the list of items, dynamically rendering the appropriate breadcrumb item (link or page) and separator between them. It uses the helper components (`Breadcrumb`, `BreadcrumbList`, `BreadcrumbItem`, `BreadcrumbLink`, `BreadcrumbPage`, and `BreadcrumbSeparator`) for composing the overall structure, ensuring separation of concerns and maintainability.### Example Usage```tsx<Breadcrumbs breadcrumbItems={[  { label: "Home", href: "/" },  { label: "Products", href: "/products" },  { label: "Headphones" }]} />```This example renders a breadcrumb navigation for a path like:Home → Products → Headphones (with "Headphones" being the current page).

## Button The `Button` component is a highly customizable and accessible UI element designed for various use cases.It supports different styles, sizes, icons, and interaction behaviors.### Features:- **Multiple Variants**: Choose from `"secondary"`, `"link"`, and `"icon"` styles.- **Size Options**: `"sm"`, `"lg"`, and `"icon"` for different use cases.- **Active State**: If `active` is `true`, an `X` (close) icon appears to indicate an active button.- **Icon Support**: Can display an additional icon alongside the button label.- **Removable Buttons**: If `onRemove` is provided, clicking the close icon triggers the callback.- **Flexible Rendering**: Use `asChild` to render as a different HTML element (`<a>`, `<div>`, etc.).### Props:| Prop       | Type                                      | Description ||------------|-------------------------------------------|-------------|| `variant`  | `"secondary" \| "link" \| "icon"`        | Defines the button style. || `size`     | `"sm" \| "lg" \| "icon"`                 | Controls the button size. || `active`   | `boolean` (default: `false`)              | If `true`, the button displays an active state with a close icon. || `icon`     | `React.ReactNode`                         | Adds an icon to the button. || `asChild`  | `boolean` (default: `false`)              | If `true`, renders as a different component (e.g., `<a>`). || `onRemove` | `() => void`                              | Callback triggered when the close icon (`X`) is clicked. || `children` | `React.ReactNode`                         | Button label or content. |### Accessibility Considerations:- The `X` close icon prevents event bubbling to avoid unexpected behaviors.- Uses `data-attributes` (`data-variant`, `data-size`, `data-state`) to manage styles dynamically.- Supports keyboard accessibility and screen readers.### Challenges & Considerations:- **Styling Optimization**: Instead of multiple `className` conditions, styles are handled via CSS Modules using `data-attributes`.- **Avoiding Unnecessary Renders**: Ensured `onRemove` only executes when necessary.- **Composable Design**: Using `Slot` from `@radix-ui/react-slot` allows wrapping the button with other components seamlessly.

## CaptchaThe `Captcha` component is a simple, customizable CAPTCHA validator for verifying user input.It is designed to add a lightweight security check against bots or automated interactions.### Features:- **Random CAPTCHA Code**: Automatically generates a 6-character alphanumeric CAPTCHA code.- **User Input Verification**: Compares user input with the generated code.- **Dynamic Validation Message**: Displays success or error messages based on user input.- **Callback Support**: Triggers `onVerify` callback with the result of the validation.### Props:| Prop       | Type                     | Description ||------------|--------------------------|-------------|| `onVerify` | `(isValid: boolean) => void` | Callback triggered after CAPTCHA validation. Receives a boolean indicating if the validation was successful. |### Accessibility Considerations:- Includes `placeholder` in the input field to assist screen readers.- Validation messages are rendered as text updates for clear feedback.- CAPTCHA code is displayed as plain text, making it easy to read.### Challenges & Considerations:- **Security**: Intended for basic protection; not suitable for high-security applications.- **User Experience**: Ensures validation feedback is immediate and easy to understand.- **State Management**: Tracks the CAPTCHA code, user input, and validation status using `useState`.

## CardThe `Card` component is a customizable container that can hold various content, such as text, images, and other elements.It is designed to be flexible and can be styled with custom CSS.### Props- **width** (string | number, optional): Defines the width of the card.

## TileThe `Tile` component is a simple navigational card used to represent account-related actions,like navigating to Personal Information or Order History.It wraps its content inside a `next/link` and displays a label along with a right-facing chevron icon.### Props- **label** (string, required): The text displayed on the tile.  It typically represents the section or page it links to.- **href** (string, required): The URL path to navigate to when the tile is clicked.### Component Behavior- The tile is styled using `Tile.module.css` and has an inline layout with the label on the left  and a chevron icon (`ChevronRight`) on the right.- It uses `next/link` for client-side navigation in a Next.js app.- The chevron icon is added for visual affordance, suggesting navigation.

## TypographyThe `Typography` component is a flexible text rendering component that can be used to display different types of text, such as headlines, body text, and labels. It supports customization through various props, including font weight, color, text decoration, and variant selection.### Props- **type** (`"Headline" | "Body" | "Label"`): Specifies the type of typography. This determines the default styles applied to the text. Available values:  - `"Headline"`: For larger, more prominent text.  - `"Body"`: For regular body text.  - `"Label"`: For smaller text typically used for labels or captions.- **variant** (`number`): Specifies the variant or size of the typography. Different numeric values (e.g., `1`, `2`, etc.) correspond to different predefined styles.- **color** (`string`, optional): The color of the text. This can be any valid CSS color (e.g., `"red"`, `"#333"`, `"rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.8)"`). Defaults to `"black"`.- **fontWeight** (`"light" | "regular" | "medium" | "semibold" | "bold"`, optional): The weight of the font. Available values:  - `"light"`  - `"regular"` (default)  - `"medium"`  - `"semibold"`  - `"bold"`- **label** (`string`, optional): If provided, this value will be displayed as the text content. If not provided, the text will default to a combination of the `type` and `variant` values.- **textDecoration** (`"none" | "line-through"`, optional): Specifies the text decoration style. Available values:  - `"none"`: No text decoration (default).  - `"line-through"`: The text will have a line through it, often used for indicating strikethrough text.### Component Behavior- The component dynamically generates class names based on the `type` and `variant` props. This allows different styles for headlines, body text, and labels with different variants.- The font weight is determined by the `fontWeight` prop, allowing the text to be rendered in different weights (light, regular, medium, semibold, bold).- The color and text decoration are customizable via inline styles. The `color` prop controls the text color, and the `textDecoration` prop allows for strikethrough or no decoration.- If the `label` prop is provided, it is displayed as the text content. If not, the component will display a default text like `"Headline 1"`, `"Body 2"`, etc., based on the `type` and `variant`.### Example UsageHere's a simple example of how to use the `Typography` component:```tsx      <Typography type="Headline" variant={1} color="blue" fontWeight="bold">        This is a bold headline      </Typography>      <Typography type="Body" variant={2} color="gray">        This is body text with variant 2      </Typography>      <Typography type="Label" variant={1} color="green" textDecoration="line-through">        This is a label with a line-through      </Typography>```

## Molecules

## Accordion A flexible and accessible accordion component used to display collapsible content sections.### Accordion- The root wrapper component that renders the entire accordion.- Accepts a `type` prop (defaulting to "single") to control the accordion's behavior (either a single collapsible item or multiple).- The `collapsible` prop allows sections to be individually collapsed or expanded.- Renders child components of `AccordionItem` to create the collapsible sections.- Accepts `contentStyle` prop to customize the style of the content in each accordion section.### AccordionItem- Represents an individual accordion section.- Accepts a `value` prop to uniquely identify the section.- Contains the accordion trigger (header) and content components.### AccordionTrigger- Represents the clickable header of an accordion item.- Triggers the collapsing/expanding behavior of the `AccordionContent`.### AccordionContent- Represents the collapsible content of an accordion item.- By default, the content is hidden until the trigger is clicked.- Accepts all standard props for `<div>`.### Wrapper ConceptThe **Accordion** component serves as the primary wrapper for the accordion's structure and behavior. It manages the accordion's collapsible state and renders individual sections (`AccordionItem` components) based on the `items` prop.The `items` prop is an array of objects with `title` and `desc` properties, where `title` is the heading of the accordion section (rendered as the trigger) and `desc` is the content (rendered inside the collapsible section).The `AccordionWrapper` component wraps the entire accordion and handles the collapsible behavior, determining how many sections can be open at a time based on the `type` prop. By default, the accordion allows only one section to be open at a time (`type="single"`), but it can be customized for multiple open sections.The `AccordionItem` components use the `AccordionTrigger` and `AccordionContent` to define the clickable header and collapsible content respectively. The `contentStyle` prop can be used to customize the appearance of the content.### Example Usage```tsx<Accordion  items={[    { title: "Section 1", desc: "This is the content of section 1" },    { title: "Section 2", desc: "This is the content of section 2" },    { title: "Section 3", desc: "This is the content of section 3" }  ]}  contentStyle="custom-content-style"/>```This example renders a collapsible accordion with three sections. Each section has a `title` (rendered as a clickable trigger) and a `desc` (rendered as the collapsible content).

## BannerThe `Banner` component is a customizable banner that displays a title, subtitle, description, and a button with a background image.### Props- **title** (string): The main heading displayed on the banner.- **buttonText** (string): The text displayed on the button.- **subtitle** (string, optional): A secondary heading that appears below the title.- **description** (string, optional): A short description displayed beneath the subtitle.- **backgroundImage** (string, optional): The URL of the background image for the banner.- **alignment** (string, optional): Controls the text alignment. Available values:  - `left-top`, `left-center`, `left-bottom`  - `center-top`, `center-center`, `center-bottom`  - `right-top`, `right-center`, `right-bottom`    Defaults to `center-center`.- **buttonLink** (string, optional): The URL to navigate to when the button is clicked.### Component Behavior- The banner adjusts its layout based on the `alignment` prop, determining horizontal   and vertical positioning of the text.- If `backgroundImage` is provided, it sets the banner's background.- Clicking the button navigates the user to `buttonLink`.

## BannerCarouselThe `BannerCarousel` component is a rotating carousel that displays a series of banners with a mix of text and image cards. It automatically cycles through the banners every 8 seconds.### Props- No external props are passed directly to the component.### Component Behavior- The component cycles through a set of banners (`bannerData`) every 8 seconds, showing different   cards consisting of text and images.- Each banner can contain text with a title, subtitle, description, and a link or it can contain   images.- The `VIEW MORE` button is only shown for text cards that contain a link.- The carousel will also display pagination dots that correspond to the number of banners.- The current banner's index is tracked and updated as the carousel cycles through the banners.

## DialogThe `Dialog` component is a composable, accessible modal implementation built on top of Radix UI's Dialog primitives.It allows developers to render dialogs with structured headers, content areas, and footers with full control over styling and behavior.### Features:- **Composable API**: Includes `Trigger`, `Content`, `Title`, `Description`, `Header`, and `Footer` for flexible modal layouts.- **Accessible**: Leverages Radix's accessibility features like focus trapping, `aria-*` roles, and keyboard interaction.- **Modular Styling**: Uses CSS Modules for styling via scoped classes like `DialogOverlay`, `DialogContent`, etc.- **Custom Trigger**: Can use `asChild` to render the trigger as any valid React element (`<button>`, `<a>`, etc.).- **Close Button**: Includes a built-in close button using Lucide's `X` icon inside the modal.### Components Exported:| Component             | Description ||----------------------|-------------|| `Dialog`             | Root provider that manages open/close state. || `DialogTrigger`      | Wraps any trigger element that opens the dialog. || `DialogContent`      | The actual modal content container. || `DialogOverlay`      | A full-screen overlay rendered behind the dialog. || `DialogClose`        | Closes the dialog programmatically. || `DialogPortal`       | Handles rendering the dialog to a React Portal. || `DialogHeader`       | Optional wrapper for dialog headers. || `DialogFooter`       | Optional wrapper for dialog footers. || `DialogTitle`        | Semantic title for the dialog, used for accessibility. || `DialogDescription`  | Semantic description of dialog content. |### Example Usage:```tsx    <Dialog>      <DialogTrigger asChild>        <Button>Delete</Button>      </DialogTrigger>      <DialogContent>        <DialogHeader>          <DialogTitle>Are you sure?</DialogTitle>          <DialogDescription>This action cannot be undone.</DialogDescription>        </DialogHeader>        <DialogFooter>          <Button variant="outline" asChild>            <DialogClose>Cancel</DialogClose>          </Button>          <Button variant="destructive">Confirm</Button>        </DialogFooter>      </DialogContent>    </Dialog>```### Accessibility Considerations:- Focus is automatically trapped inside the dialog while open.- The dialog closes when the escape key is pressed.- Includes proper ARIA roles via Radix (e.g., `role="dialog"`, `aria-labelledby`, etc.).- Dialog title and description assist screen readers for clear context.### Styling Notes:- All components use modular CSS via `dialog.module.css`.- Override styles using the `className` prop when needed.- Style hooks:  - `.DialogOverlay` — semi-transparent backdrop  - `.DialogContent` — dialog container box  - `.DialogContentClose` — close icon styling  - `.DialogHeader`, `.DialogFooter`, `.DialogTitle`, `.DialogDescription`### Challenges & Considerations:- **Portal Management**: Dialog content is rendered in a portal to avoid z-index and DOM stacking issues.- **Forwarded Refs**: All major subcomponents use `forwardRef` for better interop with animations and accessibility tools.- **Composable Layout**: Allows custom header/footer layout by not enforcing internal layout structure.

## Drawer The `Drawer` component is a customizable sliding panel that can be used to display content off-canvas, such as navigation menus, notifications, or forms. It can be positioned on either the left or right side of the screen and can include a title, description, and content sections.

Available values:  - `center` (default)  - `alignStart`  - `alignEnd`- **moveToBag** (`boolean`, optional): If `true`, the "Move to Bag" button will be displayed on each product card.### Component Behavior- The `ProductImageCarousel` renders a grid layout with a dynamic number of product cards based on the `cardsPerRow` prop.- Each `ProductCard` is passed data from the `productData` prop, including details like the product image, title, description, price, and wishlisted status.- The carousel layout is responsive and adjusts based on the number of cards per row, which is determined by the `cardsPerRow` prop.- The `width` and `alignment` props allow you to customize the appearance of the cards, while the `moveToBag` prop controls whether or not the "Move to Bag" button is displayed.### Example UsageHere's an example of how to use the `ProductImageCarousel` component:```tsx      <ProductImageCarousel        productData={exampleProductData}        cardsPerRow={3}        width={250}        alignment="center"        moveToBag={true}      />```
